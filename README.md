# hotel-booking

-- Some words to tell you, my friends:

This is almost my last project before looking for a new job. Hope everything goes well.

This project is simply searching for a location, choosing a time, choosing the number of people, choosing a hotel and booking rooms of that hotel if the selected dates do not match with the unvailable date of those rooms in the database.

And the price of the rooms will be different depending on the number of days booked and the price of each room.

That's all. Thank you for reading!
